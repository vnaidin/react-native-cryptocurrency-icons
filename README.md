# React Native Cryptocurrency Icons

This project is a React Native adaptation of [cryptoicons.co](http://cryptoicons.co), containing over 7,500 icons for almost 500 cryptocurrencies, in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All we ask is that you don‚Äôt claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

We also have some fiat currencies: `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`, `JPY`, `CNY`, `RUB`. *(We don't intend to add more)*

Images are in PNG format (transparent) in `32√ó32`, `64x64`, and `128√ó128` variants.

There's also a [`generic` icon](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/blob/master/svg/color/generic.svg) that can be used for cryptocurrencies missing an icon here.

If there is an altcoin you‚Äôre looking for that hasn‚Äôt been included, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/vnaidin/react-native-cryptocurrency-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=coin+request&template=add-currency.md&title=Add+Currency+%28Symbol%29).
